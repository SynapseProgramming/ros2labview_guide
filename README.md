# ros2labview_guide
This guide demonstrates how to send data between ROS2 and Labview. Topics covered include pub/sub with primitive data types, arrays and clusters.
I have not tested deployment on RT targets such as the Myrio or Compactrio but I am certain it is possible, as the RTI DDS toolkit supports deployment on RT targets.
